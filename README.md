# Login app
A very basic and simple project which perform various authorizationa and authentications. It allows the user to register as a new user. If the user is already registered then allow him to login and also provides the facility to reset password.

## Changes
Added [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for logging errors in a centralized location rather than logging them in console.
